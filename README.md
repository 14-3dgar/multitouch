## Installation
To use the extension, paste this link to the "Custom extension" turbowarp option on extension list:

    https://lolemo.github.io/multitouch/extension.js
## Usage
To use this extension, is important to define the stage size when the project starts. Use this block to do it:

![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LOLEMO/multitouch/main/imagen_2023-02-02_192306062.png)

> This does not modify the stage size! It only tells the extension what is it.

Now, we can start getting finger coordinates
To do it, use this reporter:

![enter image description here](https://github.com/LOLEMO/multitouch/blob/main/imagen_2023-02-02_192804782.png?raw=true)


This will return first's finger X and Y coordinates.

Change "0" to the finger you want, starting by 0. (0 is the first finger)
